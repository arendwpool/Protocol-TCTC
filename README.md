# Protocol-TCTC
The protocol as an wsdl file for the Business Process Integration subject in the Business&amp;IT master

Please consider that the file is still being tested, any comments or remarks are always welcome.

# Implementation
All the TC's have to both consume this webservice and publish it, as the communication between the TC's is two-way. The protocol is based on the TC-DC protocol, but in this case all TC's play two roles in the system: Offering an order by sending out a quotation request and awarding the LTL, and receiving the request and submitting a bid.
